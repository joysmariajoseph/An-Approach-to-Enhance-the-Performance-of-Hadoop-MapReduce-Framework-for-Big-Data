# An-Approach-to-Enhance-the-Performance-of-Hadoop-MapReduce-Framework-for-Big-Data
Hadoop optimization is requiring more attention from researchers and programmers. Many approaches is already developed to make Hadoop framework optimized. These approaches includes performances tuning and efficient clustering formation. In this research work we have developed Optimal Approach to Improve the Performance of Hadoop framework. K-Means and K-Medoids are well known clustering approaches for clustering inside Hadoop. In proposed approach a modified K-Medoids clustering algorithm has been developed which gives better result for processing inside Hadoop.
